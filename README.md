_A detailed set of Jupyter notebooks to teach semantic search and RAG patterns over public financial 10k documents with different Redis clients and integrations including: [redis-py](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [redisvl](https://redisvl.com), and [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis)._

## ‚ö° Introduction to Vector Search in Redis

[Redis](https://redis.com), widely recognized for its low-latency performance, extends beyond traditional noSQL databases. It's uniquely suited for tasks like caching, session management, job queuing, and JSON storage. With enhanced Search+Query features, Redis emerges as a performant [Vector Database](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/vector-database) supporting Vector Search over unstructured data encoded as embeddings.

## üìö Getting Started in Jupyter Notebook

Click on one of the three notebook options below to start your journey. It launches a Jupyter Notebook that prepares your environment by cloning the necessary repository artifacts, managing Python dependencies, and ends with an end-to-end walkthrough of vector search in Redis.

Select your desired notebook tutorial from below:

## üõ†Ô∏è Understanding the Client Ecosystem

Wondering why there are multiple clients? Each serves a unique purpose, providing varying abstraction levels. Your choice depends on several factors:

- **Use Cases**: Are you focusing on pure vector search, RAG, or other tasks like LLM semantic caching?
- **Redis Experience**: How comfortable is your team with Redis clients and commands?
- **Integration Points**: What are your touch points with LLMs and Embedding Providers?
- **Performance Demands**: How intensive are your performance requirements?
- **Configurability**: Do you prefer ease of use or fine-grained control?

Each notebook explores these considerations, guiding you through making an informed choice for your use case.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautionary Advice

- **Not for Local Use**: This project isn't configured for local environments. Running it outside of Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab requires a different setup.
- **Temporary Workspace**: This doesn't save your work indefinitely. Download your notebooks to avoid losing progress.
- **Idle Disconnections**: Extended inactivity in Jupyter Notebook can disconnect the runtime, potentially resulting in work loss. Regular saving is your friend!
