*A detailed set of Jupyter notebooks to teach semantic search and RAG patterns over public financial 10k documents with different Redis clients and integrations including: [redis-py](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [redisvl](https://redisvl.com), and [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis).*

# ‚ö° Introduction to Vector Search in Redis
[Redis](https://redis.com), widely recognized for its low-latency performance, extends beyond traditional noSQL databases. It's uniquely suited for tasks like caching, session management, job queuing, and JSON storage. With enhanced Search+Query features, Redis emerges as a performant [Vector Database](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/vector-database) supporting Vector Search over unstructured data encoded as embeddings.

## üìö Getting Started in Jupyter Notebook
Click on one of the three notebook options below to start your journey. It launches a Jupyter Notebook that prepares your environment by cloning the necessary repository artifacts, managing Python dependencies, and ends with an end-to-end walkthrough of vector search in Redis.

Select your desired notebook tutorial from below:

| # | Notebook | Description | Documentation |
|---|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | [**redis-py-01**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Redislabs-Solution-Architects/redis-aws-bedrock-workshop/blob/main/redis-py-01.ipynb) | Grasp VSS basics with the standard Redis Python client. | [View Docs](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/search_vector_similarity_examples.html) |
| 2 | [**redisvl-02**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Redislabs-Solution-Architects/redis-aws-bedrock-workshop/blob/main/redisvl-02.ipynb) | Dive deeper into RAG patterns from scratch using an AI-native Redis client library. | [View Docs](https://redisvl.com) |
| 3 | [**langchain-03**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Redislabs-Solution-Architects/redis-aws-bedrock-workshop/blob/main/langchain-03.ipynb) | Wrap up with an integrated approach via LangChain. | [View Docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/redis) |


## üõ†Ô∏è Understanding the Client Ecosystem
Wondering why there are multiple clients? Each serves a unique purpose, providing varying abstraction levels. Your choice depends on several factors:

- **Use Cases**: Are you focusing on pure vector search, RAG, or other tasks like LLM semantic caching?
- **Redis Experience**: How comfortable is your team with Redis clients and commands?
- **Integration Points**: What are your touchpoints with LLMs and Embedding Providers?
- **Performance Demands**: How intensive are your performance requirements?
- **Configurability**: Do you prefer ease of use or fine-grained control?

Each notebook explores these considerations, guiding you through making an informed choice for your use case.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautionary Advice
- **Not for Local Use**: This Colab-centric project isn't configured for local environments. Running it outside Colab requires a different setup.
- **Temporary Workspace**: Colab doesn't save your work indefinitely. Download your notebooks or save them to Google Drive to avoid losing progress.
- **Idle Disconnections**: Extended inactivity in Colab can disconnect the runtime, potentially resulting in work loss. Regular saving is your friend!
